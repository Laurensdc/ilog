# Server

## Must have

- Edit existing call: message
  -- Kind of done
  TODO: Pass subTask callId or something
  , subtasks not getting added
  , on edit: subtask delete -> Backend

## Nice to have

- Delete archived call

- Add some dummy seeds with Sequelize (atm, `node scripts/raw/dummySeeds` still works).
